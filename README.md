# Project Description

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the first-year Computer Science and Engineering degree at the University of Avignon. It involved creating a personal account system with a web interface and a database to display the number of people in different rooms.

## Project Responsibilities
As part of a group project, I was tasked with developing the web interface and the database. The web interface was designed to provide a user-friendly platform for users to interact with the data related to the occupancy of various rooms. It included features such as real-time updates, user authentication, and an intuitive layout for easy navigation.

The database component focused on storing and managing the data related to the number of people in different rooms. A relational database management system was implemented to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, supporting the functionality of the web interface.
